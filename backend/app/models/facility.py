"""
Facility model - Day 1 plain-Python version.
No database yet: state lives only in the `registry` class attribute.

Here, we can demonstrate simple classes, class attributes, 
and class methods. In the future, we will be using SQLAlchemy
 to manage our database models, but for now, we are keeping it simple.
