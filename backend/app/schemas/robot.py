"""
RoboPulse Fleet Command Center
Day 4 - Pydantic v2 schemas for the Robot resource.

Deliberately separate from app.models.Robot (the SQLAlchemy ORM
class) - because the ORM class is tied to the database, while these schemas
are tied to the API. This separation of concerns makes it easier to 
evolve the API independently of the database schema, and vice versa.
